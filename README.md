# Guess the States
## Overview
Hello, everyone! I'm Mert, and today is Day 25 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I've created the "Guess the States," a Python program using the Turtle graphics library. This educational game helps you learn and identify U.S. states on the map.

## Project Description
In the "Guess the States," you'll be prompted to guess and locate various U.S. states on a blank map. The game displays the name of a state, and you use the Turtle graphics library to position the state name on the correct location. The objective is to correctly guess and place all 50 U.S. states, with the game tracking your progress.


```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Run
To play the Guess the States, run the following command:



Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that you have the required files in the same directory: "main.py," "state_turtle.py," "50_states.csv," and "blank_states_img.gif."

## Project Files
* main.py: The main Python script for the U.S. States Game.
* state_turtle.py: Contains the State class for displaying and positioning U.S. states.
* 50_states.csv: CSV file containing U.S. states data, including their names, coordinates, etc.
* blank_states_img.gif: Image file representing a blank map of the U.S. states.
## Getting Started
* Run the "main.py" script to start the game.
* Enter the name of a U.S. state when prompted.
* Try to correctly position the state name on the map.
* The game will display your progress with each correct guess.
* To exit the game, type "Exit" when prompted for a state name.
## Educational Insights
This project provides hands-on experience with key Python concepts:

* Turtle Graphics: Utilizing the Turtle graphics library for interactive visual elements.
* File Handling: Reading data from a CSV file to access U.S. states information.
* Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing classes (State) to organize code and manage game entities.
* User Input Handling: Using keyboard input to interact with the game.
* Game Logic: Checking and updating the game state based on user input.
## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy playing the U.S. States Game! It's been an exciting journey reaching Day 25, and I'm eager to continue exploring and learning. Have fun learning and identifying U.S. states, and happy coding!
